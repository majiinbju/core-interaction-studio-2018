                The spherical spaceship that baby Goku crash lands on Earth in from DBZ is a clever nod to the magic stone that Sun Wukong is born from in the beginning of the novel.
                <br><br>
                Wukong was born out of a rock that had been dormant for ages on Flower Fruit Mountain (Huāguǒshān/Kakazan) that was inhabited/weathered by the sun and moon until a <a href="goku-3.html">monkey sprang forth.</a> He first distinguished himself among other fellow monkeys by bravely entering the Cave of Water Curtains (Shuǐliándòng/Suirendou); for this feat, his monkey tribe gave him the aforementioned title of "Handsome Monkey King".
