## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
> Jean Baudrillard outlines collections as the collective separation of objects of their utility. An object within a true collection becomes purely aesthetic. A true collection acts as a mirror to its ownerâ€” it is given and retains meaning through the owner's presence and care. Create or find a collection of at least 40 objects. Your assignment is divided into two stagesâ€” organization and interpretation:

> Begin to organize this collection through the design and development of a simple website
> - What does organizing this collection begin to reveal? What patterns are present? What discrepancies? 
> - What themes does this collection hold?
> - How does the site's design reflect the structures of the collection?

> Build a responsive website based on your collection by appending your JSON file.

## ðŸ’¡ Idea
> The movie La Haine tells a very interesting and avant-garde story. The film itself is shot in black and white and each scene is driven by dialogue and the chemistry between the characters. 

> The three protagonists of the movie all represent different responses to the situations they find themselves in. Vinz is more fiery and prone to aggression, while Hubert is calmer and often the most level-headed. Said proves to be a blend of the two and often finds himself confused. 

> As such, this website uses typography and colour to portray these emotions on the screen. The typography on the landing page are illustrations made by me, each phrase is taken from graffiti in the movie and relates to the character it is hyperlinked to. The progression of color aims to allude to their moods in each of the frames appended, while the hue of the color itself is a reference to their disposition.
