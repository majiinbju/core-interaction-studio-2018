## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
> The hyperlink (or link) is arguably the cornerstone of the internet. A hyperlink can transport a user from page to page, or website to websiteâ€” it acts as the linking mechanism through which the whole internet is at our disposal. Through hyperlinks, a user is able to construct their own path or narrative.

> You will design and develop a multi-page website around the hyperlink that intertwines your selected content and produces a new narrative:
> - Select two pieces of content that complement each other in some way. 
> - Think about how these pieces may fragment and weave through each other, how do they relate? 
> - Are there points where the content breaks easily? What new meaning can you construct by pairing disparate sentences together? How does seeing fragments of content on each page shift the pacing of your new narrative? 
> - Are all the links treated the same? different? What kind of hierarchy can you introduce into your narrative?).
> - Begin to think about how the site structure begins to influence the user's understanding of your texts. How might the navigation alter the contents meaning?

## ðŸ’¡ Idea
> The lyrics to *Meat Grinder*, a song by artist MF Doom, are purposefully left open to interpretation. Further, the flow to the rap is irregular and the rap itself is almost Freudian. Rather than pre-written lyrics, it sounds like Doom has let his consciousness take over and he is freely flowing through it. 

> A big part of MF Doom's personality and aesthetic is his extensive use and knowledge of samples from old shows, particularly from the '70s. His entire personality exudes nostalgia.

> Combining these two factors, I used the Genius page for the lyrics to this song and have arranged it along with gifs that allude to the various interpretations people have had over these lyrics.
