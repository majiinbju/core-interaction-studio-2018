## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
> The hyperlink (or link) is arguably the cornerstone of the internet. A hyperlink can transport a user from page to page, or website to websiteâ€” it acts as the linking mechanism through which the whole internet is at our disposal. Through hyperlinks, a user is able to construct their own path or narrative.

> You will design and develop a multi-page website around the hyperlink that intertwines your selected content and produces a new narrative:
> - Select two pieces of content that complement each other in some way. 
> - Think about how these pieces may fragment and weave through each other, how do they relate? 
> - Are there points where the content breaks easily? What new meaning can you construct by pairing disparate sentences together? How does seeing fragments of content on each page shift the pacing of your new narrative? 
> - Are all the links treated the same? different? What kind of hierarchy can you introduce into your narrative?).
> - Begin to think about how the site structure begins to influence the user's understanding of your texts. How might the navigation alter the contents meaning?

## ðŸ’¡ Idea
> *Dragon Ball Z* is about spiritual enlightenment; moving from a place of ignorance toward a place of insight and learning to harmonize and progress as a group, drawing inspiration from Mahayana Buddhism.

> The anime and manga itself is based off of an ancient Chinese novel â€“ *The Journey to the West*

> To me, all the characters are linked in one way or another, sometimes biologically and sometimes because of their emotional similarities. These connections can be construed as hyperlinks that will help create a narrative for the psychological aspect of *Dragon Ball Z*.
